# Project 1: Wall Following
{: .no_toc }

Due September 29th, 2022 at 11:59 PM.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

For complete instructions about the project, see the [Project 1 description](https://hellorob.org/projects/p1) on the main HelloRob website.

This project will be done in teams of two. The instructors will assign teammates.

## Getting the Code

One repository per team will be created for this project. Both teammates will have access to the repository and will be able to view it and make changes.
Both teammates will share ownership of the code and receive credit for writing the code through the license file.

**The invite link to accept the assignment on Github Classroom can be found on Slack.**

The first teammate to accept will need to create a new team. The team must be named **team &#35;&#35;**.  Replace **&#35;&#35;** with the team number assigned to you (for example, team 01, team 11, etc.). The next teammate should join the team from the list of existing teams.

You will be cloning the repository *on the robot's Raspberry Pi*.
See the [robot tutorial](https://robotics102.github.io/tutorials/robot.html#sec_robot_prog) for instructions on how to open a remote VSCode session connected to the robot. Once you are connected to the robot, in VSCode, open a terminal. This should be a terminal in the robot's Raspberry Pi. Then, clone the repository in the home directory:
```bash
git clone <ADDRESS>
```
Substitute ``<ADDRESS>`` with the Git address for your repo, found on GitHub. Open the folder of the repository you just cloned in VSCode using the instructions in the [robot tutorial](https://robotics102.github.io/tutorials/robot.html#sec_robot_prog).

## Submitting your assignment
Your submission for this assignment should include your code and a website portfolio of your project.
The website should feature video demonstrations of your robot completing each of the two parts of this assignment and a brief discussion.
The link to your website should be placed in the README of your GitHub repository.
For details about what should be on the website, see [Project Website](#project-website).
You should make one submission for your team. Teammates will be graded together.
Your most recently pushed commit will be graded. You should push your code to the repository.</p>

**Modify the LICENSE.txt file to include the names of all teammates.** Make sure the change is committed
to your repository.

{: .todo .fa-ul }
* <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i></span> **P1.0 (1 point):** In the file `LICENSE.txt`, replace `<COPYRIGHT HOLDER>` with the names of all teammates, separated by commas. Replace `<YEAR>` with the current year.

## Project Website

Create a website to demonstrate your implementation of the wall follower. The easiest method to create a website is to use Google Sites. You can instead create a project page on a GitHub repository, or use your favorite method to create a website. Note that if you chose to use GitHub pages, you will need to create a separate, public repository. Include at least one video demo of your wall follower as well as a brief summary and discussion of your algorithm. Add the link to your project page to the `README.md` file in the root of your repository and push it to GitHub.

*Note:* To include the video on the webpage, consider uploading your video to YouTube. Alternatively, you can upload your video to Google Drive (you have unlimited storage through your UM account). If you do this, make sure the link is accessible to the instructors when they access the web page.

Include a discussion section on the web page, where you discuss the following:
1. Your choice of control algorithm (bang-bang or P-control)
2. The strengths and limitations of the algorithm
3. How you might improve the algorithm (include at least one idea)

Include images or videos whenever possible to illustrate your points. Keep the discussion brief: it should be no longer than a few sentences.

{: .todo .fa-ul }
* <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i></span> **P1.2.4 (3 points):** Create a web page for your wall follower project including at least one video demonstration and a discussion. Add a link to the website to the `README.md` file in your repository.

## Grading Breakdown

Grades will be assigned as follows.

{: .todo .fa-ul }
* <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i></span>
      **P1.0 (1 point):**
      In the file <code>LICENSE.txt</code>, replace <code>&lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt;</code> with the names of all teammates, separated by commas. Replace <code>&lt;YEAR&gt;</code> with the current year.
* <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i></span>
    **P1.1 (2 points) DEMO:**
    Demonstrate your robot driving in a square three times to a member of the course staff.
    You should write your code in the file <code>drive_square.cpp</code>.
    Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
* <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i></span>
    **P1.2.1 (2 points):**
    In the file <code>src/common/utils.cpp</code>, complete the function <code>findMinDist()</code> so that it finds the minimum length ray in the given scan. Return the <em>index</em> of this ray.
* <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i></span>
    **P1.2.2 (2 points):**
    In the file <code>src/common/utils.cpp</code>, complete the function <code>crossProduct()</code> to find the cross product between two vectors.
* <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i></span>
    **P1.2.3 (5 points) DEMO:**
    In the file <code>wall_follower.cpp</code>, write a program that follows a wall using the procedure outlined above.
    You will need to use your functions <code>findMinDist()</code> and <code>crossProduct()</code>.
    For full points, your robot will need to successfully complete 2 laps around the course defined by the course staff.
* <span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i></span>
    **P1.2.4 (3 points):**
    Create a web page for your wall follower project including at least one video demonstration and a discussion.
    Add a link to the website to the <code>README.md</code> file in your repository.
